SwainOS Purpose

Purpose
- Create a single, AI-first business command center for Swain Destinations.
- Consolidate fragmented operational and financial data into a unified source of truth.
- Provide real-time visibility and decision support for cash, debt, FX, and operations.

Business context
- Luxury travel operator with high deposit liabilities and multi-currency exposure.
- Data currently siloed across Salesforce, QuickBooks, banking, and FX sources.
- Decisions are manual, reactive, and spreadsheet-driven.

Problem statement
- No real-time cash position versus customer deposit liabilities.
- FX purchasing decisions lack systematic analysis and timing guidance.
- Debt service tracking and covenant monitoring are manual.
- Limited forecasting accuracy and anomaly detection.

Alignment note
- Build progress is tracked in `SwianOS_Documentation/action-plan/action-log`.
